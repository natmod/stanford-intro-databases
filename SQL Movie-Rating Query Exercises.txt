Q1. Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg.

SELECT title
FROM Movie
WHERE director = 'Steven Spielberg';


Q2. Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.

SELECT DISTINCT m.year
FROM Movie m join Rating r USING (mID)
WHERE r.stars >= 4
ORDER BY m.year ASC;


Q3. Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings. 

SELECT m.title
FROM Movie m LEFT OUTER JOIN Rating r USING (mID)
WHERE r.rID IS NULL;


Q4. Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date. 

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Reviewer JOIN Rating USING (rID)
WHERE ratingDate IS NULL;


Q5. Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars. 

SELECT name, title, stars, ratingDate
FROM Movie, Rating, Reviewer
WHERE Movie.mId = Rating.mId AND Reviewer.rId = Rating.rId
ORDER BY name, title, stars;


Q6. For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie. 

SELECT name, title
FROM Reviewer natural join
    (Movie natural join
        (SELECT R1.rID, R1.mID
        FROM Rating R1, Rating R2
        WHERE R1.rID = R2.rID
        AND R1.mID = R2.mID
        AND R1.ratingDate > R2.ratingDate
        AND R1.stars > R2.stars));

Q7. For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. Return the movie title and number of stars. Sort by movie title. 

SELECT title, MAX(stars)
FROM Movie JOIN Rating USING(mId)
WHERE mID IN (SELECT mID FROM Rating)
GROUP BY title;


Q8. For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title. 

SELECT title, (MAX(stars) - MIN(stars)) AS ratingSpread
FROM Rating JOIN Movie USING (mID)
GROUP BY mId
ORDER BY ratingSpread DESC, title ASC;


Q9. Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.) 

SELECT ABS(after - before)
FROM
    (
    SELECT AVG(mav) AS before FROM
        (
        SELECT AVG(stars) AS mav
        FROM Rating JOIN Movie USING (mID)
        WHERE year < 1980
        GROUP BY Rating.mID
        )
    ),
    (
    SELECT AVG(mav) AS after FROM
        (
        SELECT AVG(stars) AS mav
        FROM Rating JOIN Movie USING (mID)
        WHERE year >= 1980
        GROUP BY Rating.mID
        )
    );
